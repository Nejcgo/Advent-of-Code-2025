Okii, yea buddy chum pal, this is some hot tier shit. Not because I'm bad at coding ofc (who said that), but because this is what I love doing: being silly.

If you don't like being silly, get dafuckckc outta here mane, you ain't built for the streets.

Yea, I'm a gangsta like that. You know my first python project wasn't even hellow orld. Crazy, I knoe. I really got into the advanced stuf early, like you probably don't even know hoe to sort a list.
(hint: .sorted())

Day one is simple, I won't be bothering you yet, but just you wait. I might actually miss some days cuz the code is still running.
